THIS PROJECT NEEDS A NEW DEVELOPER!!!!  Contact me if you are interested!   Anyone may apply. I've decided to give this project to the world.   I do not have time to maintain it.

obd2ner is designed to accept obd codes and output cooked values. It also has the ability to check every code for response on a car.

All of the classes were written in eclipse, with the exception of the GUI which was written in NetBeans.

Blue-tooth operation requires a bash driver which works under Linux to turn the OBD2 device into a character device called /dev/obd. For USB simply ln -s /dev/ttyUSB0 /dev/obd" See the downloads section for the Linux driver.  This project is not designed to work with windows
